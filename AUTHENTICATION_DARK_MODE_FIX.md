# ðŸ”§ Authentication Dark Mode Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

The dark/light theme switching was working for the main navigation but authentication pages (login/register) were not fully supporting dark mode. Only the navbar was applying dark theme, while form elements and content areas remained in light mode.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that Jetstream's default authentication components hadn't been updated with dark mode CSS classes. These components include:

-   Authentication card container
-   Form inputs, labels, and buttons
-   Validation error messages
-   Links and text elements
-   Checkboxes and form controls

## âœ… Components Fixed

### 1. **Authentication Card** (`components/authentication-card.blade.php`)

```blade
<div class="min-h-screen flex flex-col sm:justify-center items-center pt-6 sm:pt-0 bg-gray-100">
    <div class="w-full sm:max-w-md mt-6 px-6 py-4 bg-white shadow-md overflow-hidden sm:rounded-lg">
```

**After:**

```blade
<div class="min-h-screen flex flex-col sm:justify-center items-center pt-6 sm:pt-0 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900 theme-transition">
    <div class="w-full sm:max-w-md mt-6 px-6 py-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 shadow-md dark:shadow-gray-700/50 overflow-hidden sm:rounded-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 theme-transition">
