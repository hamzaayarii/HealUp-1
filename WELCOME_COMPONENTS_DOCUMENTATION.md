    -   Smooth scrolling and intersection observers

## Benefits of This Structure

### 1. **Maintainability**

-   Each component has a single responsibility
-   Easy to locate and modify specific features
-   Consistent component patterns

### 2. **Reusability**

-   Components can be reused across different pages
-   Props system allows customization
-   Consistent design language

### 3. **Performance**

-   JavaScript extracted to separate file for better caching
-   Components load only when needed
-   Optimized asset bundling with Vite

### 4. **Developer Experience**

-   Clean, readable code structure
-   Easy to understand component hierarchy
-   Better debugging and testing capabilities

### 5. **Scalability**

-   Easy to add new features or modify existing ones
-   Component-based architecture supports growth
-   Consistent patterns for team development

## Usage Examples

### Using Progress Circle Component

```blade
<x-welcome.progress-circle
    percentage="70"
    color="green"
    label="Daily Steps"
/>
```

### Using Feature Card Component

```blade
<x-welcome.feature-card
    icon="check-circle"
    title="Daily Habit Tracking"
    description="Build and maintain healthy habits..."
    gradient="from-green-50 to-emerald-100"
    iconBg="bg-green-600"

## File Size Comparison

| Aspect          | Before     | After         | Improvement             |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Main file       | 913 lines  | 25 lines      | 97% reduction           |
| JavaScript      | Inline     | External file | Better caching          |
| Components      | Monolithic | 14 modular    | Highly organized        |
| Maintainability | Difficult  | Easy          | Significant improvement |

## Build Integration

The components are integrated with Vite build system:

-   Automatic asset optimization
-   Hot module reloading in development
-   Efficient production builds
-   TypeScript support ready

This modular approach maintains the exact same visual appearance and functionality while providing a much more maintainable and scalable codebase.
